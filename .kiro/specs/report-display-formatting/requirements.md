5. WHEN reviewing step failures THEN the system SHALL show before/after state information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a test report viewer, I want advanced search and filtering capabilities, so that I can quickly find specific test results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN searching test results THEN the system SHALL support full-text search across features, scenarios, and steps
2. WHEN filtering by multiple criteria THEN the system SHALL support AND/OR logic combinations
3. WHEN using advanced filters THEN the system SHALL provide date range, execution time, and custom tag filters
4. WHEN searching THEN the system SHALL highlight matching text and provide result counts
5. WHEN applying filters THEN the system SHALL save filter state in URL for sharing and bookmarking

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a team lead, I want customizable dashboards and views, so that I can focus on metrics most relevant to my team.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL allow customization of visible widgets and metrics
