# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The GitHub Pages deployment is currently failing to load essential assets including manifest.json, favicon files, and CSS bundles. Users visiting the deployed site encounter multiple 404 errors that prevent the application from loading properly. This spec addresses the deployment configuration issues to ensure all assets are correctly built and served on GitHub Pages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the GitHub Pages site, I want all application assets to load correctly so that I can use the Cucumber Test Results Viewer without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the GitHub Pages URL THEN the manifest.json file SHALL be accessible and return a 200 status
2. WHEN the application loads THEN all favicon files (16x16, 32x32) SHALL be available and load successfully
3. WHEN the page renders THEN all CSS bundles (vendors.css, app.css) SHALL load without 404 errors
4. WHEN the application initializes THEN all JavaScript bundles SHALL be accessible and execute properly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer deploying to GitHub Pages, I want the build process to generate all necessary assets in the correct directory structure so that the deployment works seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN it SHALL generate all assets with correct relative paths for GitHub Pages
2. WHEN assets are built THEN they SHALL be placed in the correct public directory structure
3. WHEN the deployment occurs THEN the base URL SHALL be configured correctly for the GitHub Pages subdirectory
4. WHEN the build completes THEN all referenced assets in index.html SHALL have valid paths

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a site administrator, I want the GitHub Actions workflow to properly build and deploy the application so that updates are automatically published without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to main branch THEN the GitHub Actions workflow SHALL build the application successfully
2. WHEN the build completes THEN all generated assets SHALL be committed to the gh-pages branch or appropriate deployment location
3. WHEN the deployment finishes THEN the GitHub Pages site SHALL be updated with the new build
4. WHEN the workflow runs THEN it SHALL handle any build errors gracefully and provide clear error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user accessing the application, I want the PWA features to work correctly so that I can install and use the app offline if desired.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the manifest.json loads THEN it SHALL contain valid PWA configuration
2. WHEN a user visits the site THEN the browser SHALL recognize it as an installable PWA
3. WHEN the service worker loads THEN it SHALL register successfully for offline functionality
4. WHEN assets are cached THEN they SHALL be available for offline use

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer debugging deployment issues, I want clear error handling and logging so that I can quickly identify and resolve any deployment problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged clearly in GitHub Actions
2. WHEN assets fail to load THEN the application SHALL provide fallback behavior where possible
3. WHEN the build process encounters issues THEN it SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages
4. WHEN debugging deployment THEN source maps SHALL be available for development builds
