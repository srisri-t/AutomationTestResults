# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will implement a comprehensive dark mode theme system for the cucumber report viewer application. The system will provide users with a visually appealing dark theme option featuring navy blue and grey color schemes, along with a theme toggle mechanism to switch between light and dark modes. The implementation will ensure proper contrast ratios, accessibility compliance, and consistent styling across all components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to toggle between light and dark themes, so that I can use the application comfortably in different lighting conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle button THEN the system SHALL switch between light and dark themes instantly
2. WHEN the user refreshes the page THEN the system SHALL remember and apply the previously selected theme
3. WHEN the theme is changed THEN the system SHALL apply the new theme to all visible components without requiring a page reload
4. WHEN the user first visits the application THEN the system SHALL detect and apply the user's system preference (dark/light mode)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want a visually appealing dark theme with navy blue and grey colors, so that I have a modern and professional interface that reduces eye strain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL use a navy blue (#1a202c) primary background color
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL use grey (#2d3748) for secondary backgrounds and cards
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL use light grey (#e2e8f0) for primary text content
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL use medium grey (#a0aec0) for secondary text content
5. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the system SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility (minimum 4.5:1 for normal text)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all report components to be properly styled in dark mode, so that I have a consistent viewing experience across the entire application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the report viewer component SHALL display with appropriate dark theme colors
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the reports collection component SHALL use dark theme styling for cards and lists
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the report uploader component SHALL maintain dark theme consistency
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all buttons, inputs, and interactive elements SHALL use appropriate dark theme colors
5. WHEN dark mode is active THEN status indicators (passed/failed/skipped) SHALL remain clearly distinguishable with appropriate color adjustments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme toggle to be easily accessible, so that I can quickly switch themes when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any page THEN the theme toggle button SHALL be visible in the header or navigation area
2. WHEN the user hovers over the theme toggle THEN the system SHALL show a tooltip indicating the current theme and toggle action
3. WHEN dark mode is active THEN the toggle button SHALL display a sun icon or light mode indicator
4. WHEN light mode is active THEN the toggle button SHALL display a moon icon or dark mode indicator
5. WHEN the toggle is clicked THEN the system SHALL provide smooth visual feedback during the theme transition

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the dark theme to meet accessibility standards, so that I can use the application effectively regardless of my visual capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dark mode is active THEN all text SHALL meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)
2. WHEN dark mode is active THEN focus indicators SHALL be clearly visible with appropriate contrast
3. WHEN using screen readers THEN the theme toggle SHALL be properly announced with current state
4. WHEN dark mode is active THEN error messages and alerts SHALL maintain sufficient contrast and visibility
5. WHEN navigating with keyboard THEN all interactive elements SHALL have visible focus states in dark mode
